# gOS
Welcome to the gOS, inspired by /g/.

Things done so far:
* Default Windows XP background
* Can chage the default background
* Plays Windows XP startup sound on page load
* Stolen logo that spins using CSS
* If/Else statements

Things to do:
* New logo (current one is the Clover logo)
* Enable saving of user data
* Modularness
  * 'App' support
* gOS as a bootable OS (probably just a Chromium wrapper in fucking Gentoo or some shit)
* Built in music app and photo gallery
* Multiple window support
* Resize and move windows
